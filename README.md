# ðŸ‘‹Welcome to one of our Getting Started machine learning competitions.
This particular challenge is perfect for data scientists looking to get started with Natural Language Processing. The competition dataset is not too big, and even if you donâ€™t have much personal computing power, you can do all of the work in our free, no-setup, Jupyter Notebooks environment called Kaggle Notebooks.

# Competition Description
Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency theyâ€™re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).
But, itâ€™s not always clear whether a personâ€™s words are actually announcing a disaster.

In this competition, youâ€™re challenged to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which oneâ€™s arenâ€™t. Youâ€™ll have access to a dataset of 10,000 tweets that were hand classified. If this is your first time working on an NLP problem, we've created a quick tutorial to get you up and running.
